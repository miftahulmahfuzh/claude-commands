 * that asks stalls its dependents, a coordinator that asks stalls the whole set") is
 * enforced today only by prose in a prompt -- and a prompt is advice, not a mechanism.
 * This hook answers the tool call instead of letting it render, so the stall cannot
 * happen rather than being asked not to.
 *
 * The session learns it belongs to a swarm from the environment `swarm.py spawn` hands
 * its child, not by parsing the ledger here: swarm.py stays the single reader of that
 * format, and an env var survives a cwd change that a path lookup would not.
